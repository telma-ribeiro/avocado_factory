| Avocado lovers.  	| Avocado trees take too long to be mature enough to give fruit (from 5 to 13 years).  The client profits with the waiting time reduction to obtain a biological avocado. 	| Information System that based on information provided by sensors changes temperature, humidity, light in order to grow faster the avocado tree. 	| Cost reduction due to the automated process to control all the needs as well the use of innovative tree growth technology which will allow to improve nutritional habits of all clients due to a fast delivery and  product quality. 	|


# Vision statement 
We believe in a world where everyone can buy a grown avocado tree without have to take care of it for ten years before being able to eat their delicious avocado.
